From what I've gathered you grew up nice and sheltered
With mama's pretty stories and your own made up furies
And mama gave me a magic clicker
Well yes, I think it's true and fair to say

C'mon in and listen, lost words you've been missing
Of the fire you're bearing the eye of the darkness, your light

So you were drawn to stories early on?
My dreams would light up my imagination
And you had nightmares night and day?
Yeah, but with the clicker I chased those frights away
Who knew?
So true

So hеre is a clue of hope to rеmember
Visions, they come true obeying the light switch too

Show me the Champion of Light
I'll show you the Herald of Darkness
Lost in a never-ending night
Diving deep to the surface

And all your stories of crime and chilling thrillers
Of hardboiled killers became best-sellers
(And the award goes to Alan Wake)
It was all too much I had to get away
The story's the end-all a piece of true fiction
Made meaningless in the face of creation

But there is more to it than meets the eye
I never meant for it to ruin my life that way
Would you say you lived a jaded lie?
Dark shades could never save the day
So sad
But true

Fighting the nightmares, torch and a light switch
A gift or a curse, a reality made of dreams

Show me the Champion of Light
I'll show you the Herald of Darkness
Lost in a never-ending night
Diving deep to the surface
